## Michael firm-low wage worker samples (CIT-IRP5)

### Base

All ag farms & observed from 2010 or 2011 & dropping years other than 2010-2016 & workers earning $<$ R5400 per month for all periods.

### Unbalanced

All base farms, dropping farm-year observations with missing value in key sales and cost variables (value_added, g_cos, g_sales, irp5_kerr_weight_b, x_labcost).

### Survivor

Unbalanced panel & dropping farms with a missing observation for some year.

### Unbalanced

All base farms, dropping farm-year observations with missing value in key sales and cost variables (value_added, g_cos, g_sales, irp5_kerr_weight_b, x_labcost).

## Makes an economic sense that capital intensity increased. 

## Employment is unchanged after 3 years, but it is relative to the control trend. Need to plot the control employment as a reference.  
<!--Why did not survivor farms change employment after 3-4 years?  -->

Economic rationale:  
* If wage costs increased, how does a producer maintain employment, while increasing capital intensity?

---
class: inverse,  middle

## Why did survivor farms initially substitute high wage workers with low wage workers?  

Technological feasibility:  
* If low wage workers = seasonal workers, how can their tasks be substituted?  

Economic rationale:  
* If low wage workers are more affected by minimum wage increase, why does a producer want to use more of a factor whose price became more expensive?

# How should we summarise?

---
class: inverse

## Large farms held seasonal employment, reduced non-seasonal new hires and employment (except non-survivors held non-seasonal employment unchanged). 

* Corporate (CIT) farms reduced non-seasonal new hires and employment, but held seasonal employment at level (except non-survivors reduced new hires).  
* Marginal (Non-CIT) farms reduced non-seasonal employment.  

--

## Large and small farms: Seasonal workers are hard to reduce. Non-seasonal workers were reduced in some cases. Substituted high skilled with low sklled workers?  

---
class: inverse

## Headline: Capital intensity&uarr;  

--

## Possible headline: Stable seasonal employment but reduced non-seasonal employment?  

--

## Possible mechanism: High skilled workers are substituted by machines?  

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# Other things to consider

---
class: inverse

## Regardless of using which/both of unbalanced vs. survivor (complete) panel, need to consider how attrition affect results.  

--

### Are the treated more likely to attrit than the control? 

--

### If so, impacts may be more adverse than estimated.  

--


### To know about it, regress

$$
attrit=a\times characteristics + b\times characteristics*treated + e. 
$$
### and test $b=0$.
