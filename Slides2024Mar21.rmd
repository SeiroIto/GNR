# Motivation

class: inverse
name: Intro1

## Why minimum wages

--

## Policy interests: Objective = poverty alleviation

--

## Academic interests: [Reduce employment?](#NeumarkShirley)

--

## An emerging concensus: Does not necessarily reduce employment. 

--

* A survey of research economists `r Citep(myBib, "Geide2020")`  

--

* David Card received the Nobel Prize `r Citep(myBib, "CardKrueger1994")`  

--
<br>

## If not reduce employment, it should reduce poverty

---
class: inverse
name: Intro2

## Why will not minimum wages reduce employment?

--

## Oligopsony

--

* Labor costs&darr; : Decrease quits, increase job searchers (...job search models)  

--

* Wage floor&uarr; discretely: Marginal costs of labour = 0 (for a while, [static monopsony models](#MCIsAboveSCurve) )  

--

* `r Citet(myBib, "Robinson1933")`; `r Citet(myBib, "BhaskarManningTo2002")`  

--

## Competitive labour markets: MW&uarr; &rarr; employment&darr;

--
<br>
## So which one is it?

--
<br>
## Differs by market. Let's see what the data show.

class: inverse

## Agricultural MW .red[may have reduced employment] in South Africa

* 2003 MW introduction: Descriptive arguments of disemployment despite "increased" in estimated results `r Citep(myBib, "BhoratKanburStanwix2014", after = ", contrasted with similar industries")`, disemployment of certain crops `r Citep(myBib, "MurrayVanWalbeek2007", after = ", sugar cane in KZN coasts")`  
* 2005 MW increase: Disemployment prediction based on wage elasticity estimates `r Citep(myBib, "Conradie2005", after = ", wine grapes in WC")`  
* 2007 MW unification: Increased tractor sales `r Citep(myBib, "ChrisRulofRankin2015")`, firn profit and employment reduction for some crops using district level data `r Citep(myBib, "ItoSeiro2021")`  

--

## .red[No definitive evidence] by far. 

--

<br>
## Potential culprit: Small sample size

* Cannot identify small effects, can only admit large effects  
* Can result in unignorable sampling errors: Accidentally sampled in a biased way

## Data: South African Revenue Services

### Corporate Income Tax (CIT)

* Formal establishments: Anual net income $>$ R2000 (USD `r round(2000/7.3)`).  
* Revenue, profit, capital, various cost components.

### Employee Income Tax Certificates (IRP5)

* Individuals: Anual income $>$ R2000.  
* Job duration, incomes.  
   * Seasonal workers: Duration less than 6 months  
   * Low wage workers: Monthly income $<$ R5400 (USD `r round(5400/7.3)`)  
   * .blue[Fraction affected] of each firm  
* Cannot distinguish part time workers. We do not have wage rates or work hours.

# Identification strategy

class: inverse
## Estimating equation `r Citep(myBib, "HarasztosiLindner2019")` 

\begin{equation*}
\% \mbox{ change in }y_{it} = \alpha_{t}+\beta_{t}FA_{i}+\bfgamma'\bfx_{it}+\epsilon_{it}.
\end{equation*}

$\beta_{t}$ measures impacts of sub-MW worker % on % change of $y_{it}$ (base: 2012).

--

<br>
## Crucial assumption = .red[*Common rate*]: % change in *y* is common for all value of *FA* 

--

<br>
## We can observe/test if it holds for pre-policy periods

* But we cannot screen results based on pre-policy trends: A pre-test bias `r Citep(myBib, c("Roth2021", "RambachanRoth2023"))`

## Things to worry about in our data

--

### Informal sector: No enforcement, limited data

* Ignores spillovers to/from informal sector if only estimated with formal sector data  
* Can result in .orange[amplified] impact estimates `r Citep(myBib, "Boerietal2011")`  
* .red[Interpretation]: A job lost in formal sector, gained in informal = still a welfare loss  

--

### Limited compliance

* Low rate: Estimated as 44% are paid less than MW in 2007 `r Citep(myBib, "Bhorat2012")`   
* Results in .orange[underestimation] of impacts  
* .red[Interpretation]: Disemployment could have been worse (despite labour oligopsony can sustain $L$ to an extent)  
* We can [observe it in data](#Compliance) (with a reservation: parttimers are included)  

--

### No wage rates, work hours: Part timers are included in *FA*

* $FA$ may be overstated, so exposure could have been smaller, leading to .orange[underestimation].  

--

### Attrition

* If higher $FA$ firms attrit more, leading to .orange[underestimation] of impacts.

## MW was introduced in agriculture in 2003.  

--
<br>
## MWs were anually adjusted for inflation. But a major strike broke out in 2012.  

--
<br>
## March 1, 2013: 50% increase (R70&rarr;R105 per day) in agri MW.

--
<br>
## Almost no study on 2013 MW hike. No control group.  

--

* `r Citet(myBib, "PiekFintelKirsten2023")`: Non-seasonal employment growth decreased through slower rates of entry.

# Conclusion
---
class: inverse

# MW does not necessarily but will reduce employment if it is raised too much.  
--
<br><br>
# MW hike in 2013 reduced the growth in low wage employment. Firms responded with mechanisation. It was an overkill.  
--
<br><br>
# A large hike impact can only be estimated with MEE data.
